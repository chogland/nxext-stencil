# Accordion: Overview

`Accordion` contains a title and chevron that is displayed in order to expand additional content. The content for a given accordion can be placed directly inside of the `AccordionItem`. When the `AccordionItem`
is expanded, the content within the item is displayed.

## Variations

### Default

Default `Accordion` allows for the individual control of whichever item is selected.

### Item Title Slot

For more complex accordion titles you may utilize the accordion item's `item-title` slot. A good use case for using the title slot rather than the prop which accepts a string, is if you want to add a leading icon to your accordion.

### Multiple Accordion Items

This `Accordion` is the default, which allows you to open and close each `AccordionItem` at will.

### Collapse Others (Single)

The `Accordion` component accepts a selectionMode [prop](#properties) which can be set to _single_ or it's default of _multi_. Single, as shown below, only allows one `AccordionItem` to be expanded at a time.
