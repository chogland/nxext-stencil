# Action Bar: Overview

The `ActionBar` component is made up of multiple `Action` in the form of clickable icons. The action bar can be expanded to view actions with descriptive text or made smaller to view with just icons.

## Variations

### Default

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-action-bar-stories--default-story"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Collapsed

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-action-bar-stories--collapsed"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> Although actions may change, the placement of the bar should persist until the task is successfully submitted.

> Action Bars can contain one or more distinct actions.

> The actions should be of high or medium emphasis. The bottom section should be used for less important actions.

> Actions placed in Action Bars should be grouped logically, either by usage or importance.

> To distinguish actions, take use of the [Hero Icons](?path=/story/components-hero-icons-overview--page).
