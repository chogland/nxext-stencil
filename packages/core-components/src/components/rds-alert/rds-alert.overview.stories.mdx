# Alert: Overview

`Alert` is designed for medium priority messages for the user.

An alert displays an important, succinct message, and provides actions for users to address. It requires a user action to be dismissed. Although persistent, alerts can either be interacted with or ignored.

Slots are used for the text in the Alert. The best element for alert slots is 'span'. To avoid any base styling, please do not use `RdsText` or `RdsHeadline`.

To see the slot names and descriptions, view [slots](#slots) below.

```
<span slot="title">Alert title</span>
```

### With Actions

The primary action text is provided via a slot named "action-text". When a user selects this action, an event called "rdsActionClick" is emitted. You can listen for this event in order to
take action when a user selects the primary action.

The 'dismiss' action also is provided text via a slot named "dismiss-text". When a user selects this, the alert is dismissed and an event called "rdsAlertDismiss" is emitted.

### Without Dismiss Button

By default, the alert has a `dismissible` prop that is set to true, that displays a "Dismiss" button for the user to engage with. You can remove this button to have a persistent alert by setting `dismissible` to false. See the example below.

## Usage Guidelines

> **Usage**

Alerts are for use in the context of an application either in the content area itself or within components. They require a user action to be dismissed.

> **Frequency**

Only one alert may be displayed at a time.

> **Priority**

Alerts should be for medium priority information. While the alert can be ignored; user interaction is required to dismiss the alert

> **Don't override color**

Do not use custom colors for snackbar. The colors of the snackbar variations has been designed to be consistent and accessible.
