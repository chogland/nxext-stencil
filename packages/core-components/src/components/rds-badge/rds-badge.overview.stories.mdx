# Badge: Overview

`Badges` are status modifiers to other elements which display the numerical value of an element either next to it or inside the element itself.

## Variations

### Default

`Badge` has a max _value_ displayed of 99. Any _value_ that exceeds 99 will display 99+. Alternatively you can set the `Badge` to text. See below.

<Canvas style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--default-gray"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--default-red"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--default-yellow"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--default-green"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--default-blue"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--default-purple"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Optional: With Text

Using the _text_ property allows you to set the `Badge` to show text instead of a number. Here are some examples.

<Canvas style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--text-gray"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--text-red"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--text-yellow"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--text-green"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--text-blue"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--text-purple"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Optional: With Icon

<Canvas style={{ backgroundColor: 'white' }}>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--with-icon-gray"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--with-icon-red"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--with-icon-yellow"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--with-icon-green"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--with-icon-blue"></Story>
  <Story id="components-badge-stories--with-icon-purple"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Be Concise**

Badges should never contain more than two numerals. When displaying a number over 99, `Badge` will only show 99 with a following “+”.

> **Icons**

Icons can be placed before the text or number value for the badge. We recommend `arrow-sm-*` to show increase or decrease in value. The icon color is inherited automatically and should only be changed by changing the color property of `Badge`.

<Description>{Readme}</Description>
