# Breadcrumbs: Overview

`Breadcrumbs` allow users to visualize the hierarchy of their current position in an application/website and navigate quickly through it. They are a secondary form of navigation and should never be the sole navigation on a page. The last breadcrumb in your breadcrumbs list should be the current page and should not be interactive.

One `RdsBreadcrumbs` component and multiple `RdsBreadcrumb` components should be used together to achieve the amount of breadcrumbs you would like displayed. Inside the `RdsBreadcrumb` component there is a slot for you to apply the suggested `RdsLink` component, or another that suits the needs of your project.

## Usage Guidelines

> **Never replace primary navigation**

Breadcrumbs have been devised as a secondary navigation aid and should always be used as such.

> **Show hierarchy and not history**

Breadcrumbs are not to be used if all the pages are on the same level. Breadcrumbs are intended to show hierarchy. To go back, users use the browser's back button. Replicating this facility defies the purpose of having breadcrumbs.

> **Breadcrumbs should be placed at the Page Heading level only**
