# Button Group: Overview

`Button Group` is used to organize a set of buttons together. This presentational component simply sets some styles differently for the `RdsButton(s)` placed inside it.

## Variations

_Use Tertiary Only_ for button groups. Other appearance styles are not currently supported.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-button-group-stories--primary"></Story>
</Canvas>

### With Icon

Using `RdsButton` with icon works well to add additional context to the action.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-button-group-stories--with-icon"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Icon only

You can also use icon only buttons for less prominent action set.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-button-group-stories--icon-only"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Active state

When clicking on a `RdsButton` within a group, you can use the "active" prop.
When a user clicks on a button, set "active" on the target button and remove it from others.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-button-group-stories--active"></Story>
</Canvas>

## With Full-Width Buttons on Mobile

Setting `mobileFullWidth` to 'true' sets the grouped buttons to span the full-width of the mobile screen with uniform space on each side.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-button-group-stories--with-full-width-buttons-on-mobile"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

See [RdsButton](?path=/story/components-buttons-overview--page) for appropriate usage of buttons.
