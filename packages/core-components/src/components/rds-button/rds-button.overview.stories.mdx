# Buttons: Overview

`Buttons` allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.

### UPDATES

- Button types `link` and `outline` are deprecated and will not appear as the updated `tertiary` button, if you do not change your code.

Phase 2 RDS has a **NEW** `RdsLink` component that can be easily added to your code. More details and a working example of `RdsLink` can be found at the link below

### Active Buttons

The `active` property applies styles to the _secondary_ and _tertiary_ buttons to make them appear 'active' when necessary, such as when you are filtering or using the button as part of a menu.

### Button sizes

In the phase 2 button, `size="xl"` will create a button that takes the full width of the button's parent.

## Usage Guidelines

> **Be Concise**

Button text should be concise: 1 or 2 words, no longer than 4 words, with fewer than 20 characters including spaces. Don't use punctuation marks such as periods or exclamation points.

> **Use sentence case**

Button text should always be in sentence case. Capitalization should never be used to give more prominence to a specific button.

> **Don't override color**

Do not use custom colors for buttons. The colors of different button variations have been designed to be consistent and accessible.

> **Use sentence case**

Icons can be used in buttons when additional clarity is required and the icon is highly relevant to the action. Icons should not be used for decoration.
