# Card: Overview

`Cards` are surfaces that display content and actions that pertains to a single subject. They often include interactive elements such as text, links, and buttons so that the user can access more information about that subject.

`Cards` can be comprised of smaller components that can be used in a variety of ways. An example with all available components is shown below.

The `Card` parts have their own variations and examples of those can be found in their respective stories.

- [Card Header](?path=/story/collections-card-stories-card-header--default-story)
- [Card Body](?path=/story/collections-card-stories-card-body--default-story)
- [Card Footer](?path=/story/collections-card-stories-card-footer--default-story)
- [Card Media](?path=/story/collections-card-stories-card-media--default-story)

You may also create a _simple_ card without any of the optional parts listed above. You can find one example of the simple card below, or [view all examples of simple card](?path=/story/components-card-stories-simple--default-story).

## Usage Guidelines

> Layout

- A card should always be identifiable as a single, contained unit.
- A card should be able to stand alone, without relying on surrounding elements for context.
- Multiple cards are usualy grouped together into a collection.
- When grouping cards into a collection, the first card should be positioned on the top left. Subsequent cards are laid out left to right, top to bottom.
- To make a collection of cards scannable to the user, place them in a consistent pattern.

> Content

- By default, the card height will expand to fit the contents. Content will not scroll within the card.
- Dividers can be used to indicate separate regions of the card.
- Do not change the surface color of the card.
- Do not increase the size of the shadow.
