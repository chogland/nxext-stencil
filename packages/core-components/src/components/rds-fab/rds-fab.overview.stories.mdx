# FAB (Floating Action Button): Overview

### Default

`FAB` is a fixed container that accepts text, size and icon to be displayed. It renders an `RdsIcon` as well as a `RdsButton`.

</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Represent the most common primary action with a FAB**

This should also be a positive experience, such as drafting an message, or opening a menu.

> **Only display one per screen**

FABs are position fixed. If you display more than one they will overlap eachother.

> **Do not display on every page**

FABs should be carefully placed in your application. They will get in the user's way if they are used on every page/screen.
