# File List: Overview

`FileList` is a simple pattern that includes icon and text components to offer up a file list component that uses slots to apply the details.

## Variations

### Default

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="patterns-file-list-stories--default-story"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Clickable

If your file list item has an action to take, you can use the hover-action slot which will be displayed when the file list is hovered.

**This requires the prop 'clickable' to show hover state**

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="patterns-file-list-stories--clickable"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Always Show Action

You can provide a component in the 'detail' slot to always show the interaction for the file.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="patterns-file-list-stories--action"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> Showing List of Files

Use File List to show a list of files with optional details for time uploaded or which user has interacted with a file.

> File Actions

When a file requires interaction like downloading or sharing.

<Description>{Readme}</Description>
