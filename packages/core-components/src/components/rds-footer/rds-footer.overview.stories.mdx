# Global Footer: Overview

## Global Footer

`Global Footer` has a few interchangable links to include/exclude Disclaimer, Confidentiality Notice, Survey/Feedback link, or change where "Help" links to.

`Global Footer` has had its styles updated recently as part of the Phase 2 experience. The terms link now opens as a modal within the footer instead of redirecting to FMGlobal.com. All other functionality remains the same.

You can see this in action in the _base_ [App Layout](?path=/story/patterns-app-layout-stories--base) story.

## Usage Guidelines

<div class="flex mt-8">
  <div class="pr-10">
    <img class="thumbnail" src="/app-layout/footer.jpg" alt="Footer Thumbnail" />
  </div>

  <div class="flex-grow">
    <h3>Footer</h3>
    TheÂ footer is for secondary elements such as disclaimers, terms, agreements and copyright. This would appear in our EXTERNAL facing experiences only.
  </div>
</div>

```
<RdsFooter slot="app-footer" />
```

## Default Footer

The default footer comes has the following links visible. The `Terms` link will open a modal that displays the Terms and End-User License Agreement text. The terms modal code is now part of the `RdsFooter` as part of our Phase 2 experience, so you do not need to copy any modal code for this terms modal.

## With Confidentiality Notice

This footer comes with two modals, one for `Terms` which is built-in, and another for `Confidentiality Notice` which needs to be added if you are using it. Please copy all the code below to get the code for footer and both modals.

## With Feedback

When the `survey` prop is set to `true`, the Feedback link will appear. You can change the default value of `surveyUrl` to make this link go to any of your choosing.
