# Input: Overview

`RdsInput` is a basic input that can be used to build forms, create search fields, and more.

## Variations

### Default

The default `RdsInput` component does not display any helper text, placeholder text, and is an optional field. If you would like to change these default properties, see the below examples and available props below.

</Canvas>

### Required

When the `required` prop is set to true, the optional indicator will disappear and the user will need to complete the input requirements in order to submit the form this input is a part of.

</Canvas>

### Help Text

When the `help-text` slot is present, the text will be shown below the input. Use plain text only in this slot.

Help text describes additional guidance about the input field. It should only take up a single line and should be persistently visible.

### Error / Invalid State

When the input's conditions have been attempted and are not been met, the input will be displayed in error mode. You can set the error message using the `error-text` slot. Error messages are displayed below the input line, replacing help text until fixed.

The `autocomplete` prop lets you specify what if any permission the user agent has to provide automated assistance in filling out form field values, as well as guidance to the browser as to the type of information expected in the field.

Below is an example for `autocomplete` set to 'email'. See the props for additional accepted values.
