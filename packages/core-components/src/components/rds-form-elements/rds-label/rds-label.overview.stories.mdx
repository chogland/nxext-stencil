# Label: Overview

Some Form Components already have `RdsLabel` incorporated. See [dependencies](#dependencies) below.

`SubLabel` can also be used with form elements. See [SubLabel](?path=/story/components-form-elements-sub-label-overview--page) for usage and guidance.

### Default

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-form-elements-label-stories--default-story"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

- Each field should have a `RdsLabel`. Never use a field's placeholder attribute as the primary way to label the field.
- Only one label can be associated to each unique form element.
- Label text should be short and in sentence case.
- Avoid colons at the end of labels.
