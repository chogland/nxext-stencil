# Radio Button: Overview

`RadioButton` is used for mutually exclusive choices, not for multiple choices. Only one radio button can be selected at a time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous choice is automatically deselected.

It is comprised of a set of clickable circles (the inputs) with text labels positioned to the right. If there is a group of radio buttons, a group label can be added.

## Validations

Visit the [validations overview page](?path=/story/components-form-elements-validators-overview--page) for information on validating radio button and radio button group components.

## Usage Guidelines

> **Be Concise**

Use seven or fewer radios. The label of each radio should be kept to a single line of text.

> **Use sentence case**

Radio labels should always be in sentence case. Capitalization should never be used to give more prominence to a specific radio.

> **Don't override color**

Do not use custom colors for radios. The colors have been designed to be consistent and accessible.
