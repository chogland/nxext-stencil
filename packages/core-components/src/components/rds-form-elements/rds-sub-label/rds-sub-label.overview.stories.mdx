# Sub-Label: Overview

`Sub-Label` is a component that can be used in conjunction with RDS form components to convey additional information to the user.

</Canvas>

## In Context

Below, you can see the sub-label component used alongside the Headline, Checkbox, and Radio Button components.

### With Headline

If you are using sub-label with a headline, please set the `type` property to `headline` to inherit the sub-label color intended for this scenario.

<rds-headline level={4} spacing="none">Form Headline</rds-headline>
<rds-sub-label type="headline">I am a sub-label component</rds-sub-label>

```
<rds-headline level={4} spacing="none">Form Headline</rds-headline>
<rds-sub-label type="headline">I am a sub-label component</rds-sub-label>
```

### With Checkbox

For the sub-label to appear within the checkbox component, insert a `RdsSubLabel` component within the slot named `sub-label`.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-form-elements-checkbox-stories--with-sub-label"></Story>
</Canvas>

### With Radio Button

For the sub-label to appear within the radio button component, insert a `RdsSubLabel` component within the slot named `sub-label`.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-form-elements-radio-button-stories--with-sub-label"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Use with forms**

Sub-labels should appear alongside a form header or within a slot provided by a form element. Use it to explain why a piece of information is being requested, address security and privacy concerns, or to suggest ways of providing answers other than providing formatting examples.

> **Keep length to a minimum**

While the component will automatically wrap text to the next line if needed, it is recommend to keep the sub-label to a maximum length of one sentence. This way the visual flow of the form is not interrupted and the user will be inclined to read the sub-label.
