# Headline: Overview

`Headline` creates a `<h[#]>` tag that corresponds to the level required by your content and accessiblity needs. While each headline comes with pre-defined styles including font family, font size and line-height, you should use headline for strictly semantic usage on your page.

Please refer to the [Text Component](?path=/docs/components-text-overview--page) for all of your strictly visual text needs.

Please refer to the [Typography Headings Page](?path=/docs/brand-identity-typography-headings--page) for more information on our typography rules.

## Variations

Headline levels 1-3 are pre-styled based on a visual hierachy as you can see below. After level 3, levels 4-6 will visually look the same as level 3.

## Usage Guidelines

> **Use one Level 1 Headline per page**

As per our accessiblity guidelines, there can only be one `<h1>` tag for each page. Please use levels 2-6 for additional headline needs and use the level 1 headline at the page header level.

> **Subheadings must be in a hierarchical order**

Subheadings should be nested in a hierarchical order (i.e. `<h2>` are subheads of `<h1>`, `<h3>` are subheads of `<h2>`, etc.).

> **Avoid skipping levels**

Headline levels should always start from `<h1>`, followed by `<h2>` and so on.

> **Avoid using headline components to resize text**

Please refer to the [Text component](?path=/story/components-text-overview--page) in scenarios where you want styled text that is not a true headline. The text component has many more options for resizing text and does not impact the accessibility of the page.

> **Use purposeful content**

Always use heading markup for content that serves the purpose of a heading

<Description>{Readme}</Description>
