# Hero Icon: Overview

`Hero Icons` are tailwind-made icons & are visual symbols used to represent ideas, objects or actions. They communicate messages at a glance, afford interactivity and draw attention to important information.

## Sizes

`Hero Icon` sizes range from medium to extra large.

</Canvas>

### Color

The `color` property applies a color to the icon.

You can find the list of colors supported on our [Brand Identity/Colors page](/story/brand-identity-colors--page).

The color of the icon will default to #000 or inherit from it's parent if you are not explicity setting a background color through the `bg` prop, or an icon color through the `color` prop.

## Backgrounds

The hero icon has background color options that can be passed through the `bg` prop. Options include: gray, purple, blue, green, yellow and red.

Depending on whether your icon has a `type` of solid or outline, the background and icon color will render differently.

## Shapes

When passing in a background color through the `bg` prop, you may also change the _shape_ of the background by utilizing the `shape` prop. By default, the background will display with rounded corners. You can change this by passing 'circle' into the prop.

Below you can see examples of the purple rounded and purple circle backgrounds for both solid and outline icons types.
