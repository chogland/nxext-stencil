# Image: Overview

### Image

`Image` is a basic component designed to place an image on a page. It accepts a few props that are used for `Lightbox` situations. You can also use `RdsImage` for thumbnails with or without Headlines displayed. See some examples below.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-image-stories--default-story"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Thumbnails: Small, Medium, Large and full

`RdsImage` accepts thumbnail as an attribute in order to render a thumbnail of the image provided instead. You can also set the size by providing a "size=[size]" to the `RdsImage`.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-small"></Story>
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-medium"></Story>
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-large"></Story>
</Canvas>

```
size="full"
```

When the size is set to 'full', the width of the thumbnail will be set to 100%. The height will remain the same as the large, at 208px.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-full"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Headline with Thumbnail

To show a headline next to a thumbnail, simply set the 'show-headline' attribute and provide a 'headline' to the `RdsImage`.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-with-caption-small"></Story>
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-with-caption-medium"></Story>
  <Story id="components-image-stories--thumbnail-with-caption-large"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Layout Instability**

Images served without their size specified can cause layout instability and contribute to a high Cumulative Layout Shift.

> **Download Time**

The larger the file size of an image, the longer it will take to download.
Developers can reduce image sizes through better compression and the use of responsive images.
