# Lightbox: Overview

`Lightbox` is a visual enhancement tool used with `RdsImage` to click and focus on an image in a full screen takeover.

The `RdsImage` accepts a _headline_, _detail_ and _caption_ [prop](#rds-image) that will be displayed within the `RdsLightbox` when activated.

## Using `RdsImage` within the Lightbox

- The thumbnail view of an image is not detailed enough, or when there isn't room to list all image details.
- The original size of the image is bigger than the thumbnail.

> **Do not use a Lightbox when...**

- The image you are using is smaller than or as big as the thumbnail.
- There is another click event attached to the image control.
