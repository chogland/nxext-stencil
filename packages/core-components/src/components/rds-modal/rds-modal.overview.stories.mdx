# Modal: Overview

`Modals` are positioned over every other element in the page and are used to inform users about a task or decisive information that requires immediate attention.

To activate the Modal, simply use the controls in side of the [Playground](?path=/story/components-modal-stories--default-story) to set the _visible_ prop to true, or interact with the modal trigger below to open an example modal.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="300px" id="components-modal-stories--with-modal-trigger"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Variants

### Default

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="300px" id="components-modal-stories--default-story"></Story>
</Canvas>

### With Icon and Action Items

A slot is provided for an icon as well as action items. See [slots](#slots) below for more details.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="300px" id="components-modal-stories--with-icon"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Custom HTML Headline

You can change the default title of the modal into a custom html headline using the [_headline_ slot](#slots).
[View the story for this example.](?path=/story/components-modal-stories--custom-html-headline)

### Fullscreen

You can create a fullscreen modal by setting the `fullScreen` prop to true. We recommend disabling the close button by setting `closeButton` to false and utilizing the default slot for all modal content.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="300px" id="components-modal-stories--fullscreen"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Disable Overlay's Close

In order to disable the overlay from closing the modal on-click, set the _disableOverlayClose_ prop to true. [View the story for this example.](?path=/story/components-modal-stories--no-overlay-close)

### Opening the Modal

To open a modal, simply set the _visible_ property to true, or call the _openModal()_ method.

### Dismissing the Modal

- Clicking/tapping anywhere on the overlay. _Note_ This can be disabled. See _disableOverlayClose_ property below.
- Clicking/tapping on buttons, if present. _Note_ This requires an `RdsButton` to call a method to set _visible_ property.

## Usage Guidelines

You may consider using a modal window when you need to:

> **Seek User Attention**

Use when you want to interrupt a user's current task to catch the user's full attention to something more important.

> **Workflows**

To break down a complex workflow into a series of less complicated steps. Not to include the entire workflow.

> **Accessibility**

To cater for both mouse and keyboard interactions we've included numerous ways to dismiss a modal dialog:

- click an Action in the footer
- press Esc on a keyboard
- click anywhere on the overlay (unless disabled, see [properties](#properties))
