# Navigation: Overview

## With Expand/Collapse

If your navigation has the properties of `type` equal to 'base', and `expanded` equal to true, your navigation will have its expand/collapse utility enabled. In this case, you _must_ pass icons to your individual nav items, as they will be all thats shown in the navigation's collapsed state.

  <Story height="500px" id="collections-navigation-stories--base-with-expand-collapse"></Story>
</Canvas>

## With Sub Navigation

To create a sub navigation under any `NavItem`, simply nest another `NavItem`(s) inside of it, and remove the `href` property from the parent.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="500px" id="collections-navigation-stories--base-with-sub-nav"></Story>
</Canvas>

## With Expand/Collapse and Sub Navigation

When your `Nav` has expand/collapse enabled, you can still view the child `NavItem`s. Collapse the example below to see how the sub navigation renders.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="500px" id="collections-navigation-stories--base-with-sub-nav-and-icons"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Use for page navigation**

Use this to display a navigation hierarchy with a single level.

> **Use light information architecture**

If the app has fewer than five pages, consider organizing the page without a navigational hierarchy like a Workflow layout.

> **Existing navigation**

If your page already has a horizontal and vertical navigation bar, consider ways to simplify your navigation system.

> **Show the current page**

Indicate where a user is within the navigational hierarchy. Use the “active” state to show users which page they have navigated to.

> **Keep links concise**

They can be shorter derivatives of page titles themselves.
