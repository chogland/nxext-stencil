# Pagination: Overview

The `Pagination` component is designed to break data into pages to increase load times and give the user indication of where they are in the filtered results.

## Variations

### Default

By default, the `Pagination` component is set to 10 items per page. You can change this by using the _items_ prop. See below.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="patterns-pagination-stories--default-story"></Story>
</Canvas>

### More items per page

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="patterns-pagination-stories--increased-results-per-page"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

- Pagination only includes navigation elements for paging and does not manipulate data or control the display of a data grid.
- This control is used only to provide navigation and to indicate the current page and number of pages.

<Description>{Readme}</Description>
