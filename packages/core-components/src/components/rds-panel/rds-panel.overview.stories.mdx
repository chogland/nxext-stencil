# Panel: Overview

The `Panel` is a drawer that slides in from the right side of the current view. By default, the panel is fixed or 'floating'.

> Panel's 'position' property can be set to 'push' to push content as it slides in, becoming relatively positioned.

There can be any number of panels attached to the content. A 'panel-id' can be provided to the panel in order to trigger a particular panel, or if no panel-id is provided, it will find the first panel. The `Panel` can be controlled from the templates, or programmatically using the PanelController.

Scrolling will be available when more content is displayed vertically and a custom scrollbar will be displayed.

## Variants

### Default

By default, a panel's position is fixed and the window's scrollbar is disabled when the panel is open. To change the default scrollbar behavior, set the `disableBodyScroll` prop to 'false'.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="500px" id="components-panel-stories--default-overlay-panel"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Pushed

When the panel's `position` is set to 'push', it will become relative and sit next to content as opposed to overlaying content.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="500px" id="components-panel-stories--push-panel"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Wide Panel

When the panel's `wide` prop is set to true, it will become wider. Wide panel is meant for 'overlay' type only.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story height="500px" id="components-panel-stories--wide-panel"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Styling Option

- Remove padding on inner-wrapper of the Panel.

```
<RdsPanel noPadding>
</RdsPanel>
```

## Controlling the Panel

### Panel Toggle

Panel Toggle accepts a 'panel' property which can accept the 'panel-id' of `Panel` to control a particular panel. If this property is not used, `PanelToggle` will toggle the first panel that is open. For more information on the panel toggle, view the `rds-panel-toggle` docs at the bottom of the page.

Note: When multiple panels exist on a screen, only one is allowed open at a time.

```jsx
<RdsPanelToggle autoHide="false">
  <RdsButton appearance="tertiary" label="Toggle Panel">
    <RdsHeroIcon name="x"></RdsHeroIcon>
  </RdsButton>
</RdsPanelToggle>
```

### Panel Close Button

The Panel has a property called `closeButton` that can be used to display the close button which will control itself by default. You can place your own close button or method by using the `Panel Toggle` component.

### Responsive Behavior

The panel maintains the same behavior all the way down to the extra small breakpoint, at which point it begins taking up 100% of the viewport width.

## Usage Guidelines

> **An overlay panel's tasks should be independent of page content**

Because the overlay panel hides page content, it is important to use the 'push' panel when a user needs to see both page and panel content to complete a task.

> **Panel is designed for momentary tasks**

The panel is intended to be opened/closed when the user needs it. Therefore, do not hide any lengthy, required tasks within a panel.
