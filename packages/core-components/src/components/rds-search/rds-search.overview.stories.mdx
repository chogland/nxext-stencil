# Search: Overview

`Search` is a native input that handles search functionality. Using the `RdsSearch` events and properties allows you to get the user input and apply to your search results.

### Default

By default the `Search` has a leading icon that is presentational to alert the user this input is for searching.

The trailing icon is built in and shown when the user has began typing. The trailing icon can be used to clear the input.
