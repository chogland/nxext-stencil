# Skeleton: Overview

`Skeleton` provides a visual representation of content loading before the content actually loads. Show this component before the data loads. Once the data loads, replace or remove the skeleton from the dom.

## Variations

### Default

By default the `RdsSkeleton` pulses. It will take up a 20px tall and spans full width of its parent element.

### Circle

Circle is best to show the loading of an image or other visual element before it loads.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-skeleton-stories--circle"></Story>
  <Story id="components-skeleton-stories--circle-large"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Lines

To show groups of skeletons to represent lines of text or lists you can use the [prop](#properties) _count_ to set the number of lines you want displayed.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-skeleton-stories--count"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Rectangle

This can be used to represent a larger region in an loading state. The height can be set with a [prop](#properties).

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-skeleton-stories--rect"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **When to use a skeleton**

<ul>
  <li>
    Use when you are loading dynamic content. Static content does not need a skeleton. A content area can include both dynamic and static content; i.e. Headlines (static) and body
    content (dynamic). If this is the case you can use skeletons and static content together.
  </li>
</ul>

> **Implementation**

<ul>
  <li>Use multiple skeletons to give indication of what content will load where.</li>
  <li>Always match the expected size of the dynamic content block.</li>
</ul>

> **Load in real time**

<ul>
  <li>Replace the skeleton with content as soon as it has loaded. Do not wait for all content available to replace all skeletons.</li>
</ul>
