# Spinner: Overview

`Spinner` can be used to show the loading state in your projects. Their sizing can be easily customized with the 'size' property.

For accessibility purposes, each loader here includes role="status" and a nested `<span class="sr-only">Loading...</span>`.

## Variations

### Default

<!-- By default the `RdsSkeleton` pulses. It will take up a 20px tall and spans full width of its parent element. -->

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-spinner-stories--small"></Story>
  <Story id="components-spinner-stories--default-story"></Story>
  <Story id="components-spinner-stories--large"></Story>
  <Story id="components-spinner-stories--extra-large"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Indicate Loading**

Spinners should be used to show that something is happening behind the scenes, even if we don’t necessarily know how long it will take.

> **Order of Operations**

If the design allows for a skeleton to be used or that a more specific method of communication is available, opt for that. Spinners should be reserved for more generic “loading” states.

> **Don't override color**

Do not use custom colors for spinners. The color of the spinner has been designed to be consistent and accessible.
