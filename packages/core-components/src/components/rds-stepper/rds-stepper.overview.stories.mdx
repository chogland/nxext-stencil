# Stepper: Overview

The `Stepper` component is used to indicate a step workflow. The `Stepper` component is comprised of `StepperItem`s. See [methods](#methods) for how to call next/prev step or to go to a particular step on component load. These methods would be called from a button in the slot of the `Workflow Header` and/or `Workflow Footer` through a click event.

`StepperItems` accept _active_, _complete_, _disabled_, and other [properties](#properties) in order to control the stepper state.

## Variations

### Simple Stepper

The simple stepper is the default variation of the component.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--simple"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Complex Stepper

The complex stepper has the same functionality as the simple stepper, with some additional visual elements and responsiveness.

The _icon_ `StepperItem` property is exclusive to the complex stepper.

In order to use the complex stepper, change the _type_ property to 'complex'.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--complex"></Story>
</Canvas>

The _vertical_ `StepperItem` property is exclusive to the complex, bullet, and circle steppers, and a vertical variation can be seen in the following example.

### Vertical Complex Stepper

The complex stepper will display vertically on all breakpoints when the property _vertical_ is present.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--vertical-complex"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Bullet Stepper

The bullet stepper takes up minimal space on your screen, making it a great option for both mobile and desktop views, or when you do not want the stepper to take up a lot of space.

By default, the _text_ value is not displayed visually and only exist in the DOM to meet RDS's accessibility criteria.

In order to use the bullet stepper, change the _type_ property to 'bullet'.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--bullets"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Vertical Bullet Stepper

The bullet stepper will display vertically and with its stepper item text when the property _vertical_ is present.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--vertical-bullets"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Circle Stepper

The horizontal circle stepper does not include any title or descriptive text and is a good option for stepper content that is clearly labeled and need visual representation only.

By default, the _text_ prop value and _description_ slot is not displayed visually and only exist in the DOM to meet RDS's accessibility criteria.

In order to use the circle stepper, change the _type_ property to 'circle'.

The _vertical_ `StepperItem` property is exclusive to the circle and bullet steppers, and the vertical variation can be seen in the following example.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--circles"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Vertical Circle Stepper

The circle stepper will display vertically with its title contents when the property _vertical_ is present.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--vertical-circles"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Responsiveness

When on mobile viewports (under 640px), the simple stepper displays the active item title with a "#/#" for current/totalStepperItems.

When on small tablet and mobile viewports (under 1024px), the complex stepper stacks verically instead of horizontally.

### Stepper Content

Content can be placed inside of the `StepperItem` in order to display that content when a certain step is _active_.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="collections-stepper-stories--simple"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Stepper Content Event Support

Code placed inside the stepper items gets appended to the parent component for each active step. In this process, events bound in the JSX code are removed.

In order to keep events bound to your code, you must dynamically add stepper content to your stepper.

See the example below:

```jsx
// Bind your stepper content when the stepper item is selected like this showStepperContent example function.

<RdsStepper>
  <RdsStepperItem onRdsStepperItemSelect={ev => this.showStepperContent(ev)}></RdsStepperItem>
  <RdsStepperItem></RdsStepperItem>
  <RdsStepperItem></RdsStepperItem>
</RdsStepper>
```

## Usage Guidelines

> **Stepper Titles**

Stepper titles should be few short words at most.

> **Be mindful of placement**

Don't embed steppers within steppers or use multiple steppers on one page.
