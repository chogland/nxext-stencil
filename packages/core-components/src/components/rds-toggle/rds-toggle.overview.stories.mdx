# Toggle: Overview

## Variations

`Toggle` helps users update preferences, settings, and other types of information. Keep in mind that toggle switches should only be used when the user needs to decide between two opposing states.

  <Story id="components-toggle-stories--switched"></Story>
</Canvas>

### Disabled

Pass the `disabled` prop to disable the user from engaging with the toggle.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-toggle-stories--disabled"></Story>
</Canvas>

### With Label

Using the 'Label' property allows you to add a text label that automatically references the toggle.

<Canvas withSource="auto">
  <Story id="components-toggle-stories--with-label"></Story>
</Canvas>

## Usage Guidelines

> **Keep labels for toggle switches short and direct**

> **Use when:**

- Applying a system state, not a contextual one
- Presenting binary options, not opposing ones
- Activating a state, not performing an action

> **Don't stack many toggles**

- It is best to reconsider using toggles if you find stacking them or having more than a couple in a page setting.
