# Workflow Header: Overview

Workflow header comes with three slots: title, description and action. The action slot can include more than one component if you utilize the `Grid` component as seen in the example below. The title slot, in this case, shows a `Headline`. The description slot is meant to show any additional text or components needed to complete your workflow header.

Note: The workflow header is _only_ intended for use in full page takeovers.
